    "No Covid-Hub, forma feitos modelos para casos e mortes, com forecasts por estado,\n",
    "sendo estes agregados para nível nacional. Neste notebook utilizamos os dados de nível nacional (US).\n",
    "\n",
    "Os dados reais (ground truth) de Covid se encontram no dataframe `covid_data`,\n",
    "enquanto `forecasts` contém os modelos de forecasting (ensembles e modelos componentes utlizados no ensamble).\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasts podem conter quantis ou point predictions, que está na coluna `type`. Aqui usamos somente os quantis, que\n",
    "foram os valores utilizados para o ensamble.\n",

    "### Modelos\n",

    "\"This ensemble produces forecasts of incident cases (discontinued as of February 2023), incident deaths, and cumulative deaths (discontinued as of March 2023) at horizons of 1 through 4 weeks ahead, and forecasts of incident hospitalizations at horizons of 1 through 28 days ahead. For all of these targets, the ensemble forecasts are computed as the equally-weighted median of all component forecasts at each location, forecast horizon, and quantile level.\""
